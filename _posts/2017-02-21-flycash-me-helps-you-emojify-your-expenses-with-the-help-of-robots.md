<p>Imagine this: every month you’re slightly low on cash and even though you try ever so hard to keep track of where your money is going, it’s always disappearing before your very eyes. This is a problem a lot of people have, and there are <strong>numerous ways of keeping track of where your money is going</strong>, but have you considered perhaps chatting to a bot about it?</p>
<p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/domainme/~https://flycash.me/">FlyCash.ME</a> is a service that <strong>allows you to keep track of all of your expenses and finances</strong> by simply allowing you to chat to a bot on Messenger about them. It’s like having a friend who wants to know where your money is but in a friendly way, not a creepy weird one.</p>
<p>The times are changing pretty fast, and I can’t really remember when was the last time I actually had to go to a bank to do something with my account. Through the magic of Android and iOS apps, you now only need your smartphone to keep track of the situations happening on your bank account. That’s pretty neat, and everything that helps me evade the waiting lines at banks <strong>gets a big thumbs up from me.</strong></p>
<h2>Apps – Out, Bots – In!</h2>
<p>Until now, you had to really rely on apps to do the most of the work, and we all know that finding the right app for the job can be a really frustrating thing. With all the recent trends in the industry, it really seems as if chatbots and bots, in general, are the way of the future. We’re really trying to keep track of the trend, <strong>and have written about some</strong> <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/domainme/~domain.me/chatbots-help-hiring/">interesting chatbot ideas</a> on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/domainme/~domain.me/chatclub-facebook-page-chat-bot/">quite </a>a few occasions – even <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/domainme/~domain.me/facebook-messenger-bots-marketing-apps/">telling you their marketing potential!</a></p>
<p>Our main takeaway from this is that chatbots really don’t have a large downside when it comes to functionality because they are incredibly fast and useful for the thing they are aimed for. Of course, <strong>we’re far off from the bots you can really talk to</strong>, but there are some interesting ones out there that we advise you to try, like <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/domainme/~poncho.is/">Poncho </a>or <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/domainme/~https://botlist.co/bots/956-swelly">Swelly </a>bot.</p>
<p>Banks and other large financial institutions have really <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/domainme/~https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/27/business/dealbook/banks-bet-on-the-next-big-thing-financial-chatbots.html">put their backs into</a> making the most out of this new trend, with Mastercard, the Bank of America and other brands announcing bots that will help you get a hold on your finances. You can ask them about your account balance, <strong>get financial advice and more just by talking to them through Messenger, so why shouldn’t you?</strong></p>

<h2>Banks Love Using Chatbots</h2>
<p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/domainme/~www.cnbc.com/2016/10/24/bank-of-america-launches-ai-chatbot-erica--heres-what-it-does.html">Erica </a>is the latest banking chatbot from the<strong> Bank of America</strong>, and she can track your credit score, your spending habits and offer you advice on how to best pay all those bills you have accumulated over the month. It’s clear that this is the direction the world is going right now, and <strong>banks are trying to be on the forefront of it.</strong></p>
<p>Another giant of the finance world, Mastercard, has also dipped its toes into the sea of chatbot opportunities with <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/domainme/~newsroom.mastercard.com/press-releases/mastercard-makes-commerce-more-conversational-with-launch-of-chatbots-for-banks-and-merchants/">Kai, its very own chatbot</a>. They claim that the bot will help consumers to shop and transact on messaging platforms and then check out with the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/domainme/~https://masterpass.com/us/">Masterpass</a> global payment service. What this means is that<strong> you could buy things with Mastercard directly through Messenger</strong> once the bot is working the way it’s intended to.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/domainme/~https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/10/these-chatbots-want-to-help-you-manage-your-money/">lots of bots</a> that can help you with your money, and they all tend to aim at different parts of your financial woes, like your savings account or, in the case of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/domainme/~https://flycash.me/">FlyCash.ME</a> – your daily spending habits. By helping you see where your money is going daily, this smart bot will help you manage finances better by allowing you to input your spending into the chat with the bot itself.</p>
<h2>Emojify Your Spending Habits</h2>
<p>But of course, if this bot only served one very specific purpose, we wouldn’t talk about it today. You see, considering that the world is “emojifying” insanely fast today, the people behind this bot decided do make your finance tracking fun;<strong> by allowing you to use emojis to label your expenses.</strong></p>
<p>This way, you can label your date night costs with a glass of wine emoji and your lunch with a pizza emoji. <strong>The only limit here is your creativity, really</strong>, and don’t worry that you’ll forget which emoji is which because they are all laid down into lists and really easy to read.</p>
<p>This way, you can tell the bot that you’ve bought yourself a burger for a certain amount, and followed it with some beer afterward, and he’ll remember it and label it by day and time of the purchases. At the end of the month, <strong>you’ll see all of your expenses laid out and see where your money went – with emoji!</strong></p>

<p>Of course, the biggest deal about this app is that <strong>you need to use it continuously</strong>, so the only real task for you is to make the using of the bot a part of your routine so that you don’t forget to write down the money you spend. That kind of defeats the purpose of the bot, don’t you think?</p>
<p>So, there you have it, <strong>be honest with yourself and make use of the latest in tech</strong> by having chatbots monitor your expenses. It’s a great way to know more about yourself and have a little fun at the same time!</p>
