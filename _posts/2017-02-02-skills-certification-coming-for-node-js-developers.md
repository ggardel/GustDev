This is a great news for Junior/Medium level Developers who really enjoy working with Javascript, Back End Development and is looking for certification of skills. I am sure I would get prepare to take any test needed to be certified.

Don't get so excited yet, you probably will need to have "N" years of professional experience and others requirements before having a chance to get certified.
