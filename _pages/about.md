	<h6 style="text-align: left;"> <em>Hello,</em></h6>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em style="font-size: 18px;"><em> Thanks for visiting my Website and here it is a little bit about me!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
	<p style="text-align: left;"><em style="font-size: 18px;">I was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The beautiful city where I lived and worked as a Registered Nurse (BSN) responsible for 20-bed critical care unit, with hemodynamically unstable patients highly dependent of monitoring and specialized care, until December of 2006 when I relocated to the United States.</em></p>
	<p style="text-align: left;"><em style="font-size: 18px;"><em>Here in the USA,  I have worked in the food business, healthcare and sales, I  lived in New Jersey, New York, and California.  I studied JavaScript, HTML, and CSS while I was working in healthcare at night. During the day I was doing some freelance websites for friends and small business. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em style="font-size: 18px;"><em>Since I had the opportunity to improve my knowledge with  Back-End programming,  and learning more advanced languages and technologies during General Assembly Full Stack immersive Program I decided to dedicate myself full time to my passion for web development.</em></p>
